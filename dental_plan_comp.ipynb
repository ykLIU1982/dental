    "The function, nonPremCost, calculates the annual out-of-pocket dental expense for a single adult excluding the monthly premium given the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The adult receives preventive services (exam and cleanings) twice a year at a constant rate, unitCostPrev. The insurance package have a deductible for the preventive services at prevDeduct and a copayment coverage of rPrev, 50%-100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) We only consider the adult only needs some basic teeth services beside preventive services.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The cost of basic teeth services per year is set in a range from 0 to $2000 per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) There is a deductible for the basic services at baseDeduct and the cost beyond the deductible will be paid by the insurance company at the coverage ratio of rBase.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) The total paid coverage by the insurance company is bounded by the maximum benefit, maxY, which depends on the selection of the dental insurance package ranging from \\$500 to \\$2000.\n",

    "6) In the cases when the deductible is shared by preventive services and basic services, we assume that the preventive services will first claim the deductible. The coverage of basic services will be triggered immediately after the preventive services when the latter use up the deductible, which is usually the case."
